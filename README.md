# Data Science: Disease Outbreak Simulation

## Group members

- Melissa Huynh
- Joel Daniel Rico

## Description of work

This project will use data science concepts to visualize various statistics relating to the spread of a disease. We will research the causes, identify a reliable source of data on disease spread, and practice simple deep learning algorithms. We will then clean and prepare the data for visualization, build an accessible website using SvelteKit, and visualize the data in a map, bar chart, line graph, or another type of visualization.

## Steps

Research more about data science concepts.
Read articles on disease predictions.
Research on causes of foodborne illness.
Research data sources.
Identify a reliable source of data on disease spread.
Practice simple deep learning algorithms.
Clean and prepare data.
Build an accessible website.
Visualize data.
